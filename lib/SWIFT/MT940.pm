=head1 NAME

SWIFT::MT940 - Read Structured MT940 SWIFT files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #!/usr/bin/perl
 use strict;
 use warnings;
 use SWIFT::MT940;
 use Data::Dumper;
 
 my $mt940_contents = `cat ...`; # or some other way
 
 eval {
   my $mt940 = SWIFT::MT940->parse($mt940_contents);
   print Dumper([$mt940->get_statements()]);
   print Dumper([$mt940->get_transactions()]);
 };
 if($@) {
   warn "Read failed: " . Dumper($@);
   exit;
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a module to read Structured MT940 SWIFT files. It is tested against
the Rabobank format documented at:

 https://www.rabobank.com/en/float/fl/downloads.html

Some banks may use similar formats; if you want to add support for them,
patches are welcome.

	my $stacktrace = [];
	my $i = 1;
	while(my @stack = caller($i++)) {
		push @$stacktrace, \@stack;
	}

		what => $message,
		package => $package,
		filename => $filename,
		line => $line,
		stacktrace => $stacktrace,
	};
	die $error;
}

sub assert {
	my ($cond) = @_;
	if(!$cond) {
		raise("Assertion failed");
	}
}

=head3 SWIFT::MT940->parse($data)

Parses the given data, which is a complete MT940 document. Returns a
SWIFT::MT940 object.

=cut

sub parse {
	my ($pkg, $data) = @_;
	my $self = {};
	bless $self, $pkg;
	$self->{'body'} = $data;
	$self->{'offset'} = 0;
	$self->{'statements'} = [];
	
	$self->read_magic();
	while(my $next = $self->peek_block()) {
		if($next eq "20") {
			push @{$self->{statements}}, $self->read_statement();
		} else {
			raise("Unknown tag in global scope: $next\n");
			last;
		}
	}
	return $self;
}

=head3 $mt940->get_statements()

Returns an array of statements in the data given to parse().

=cut

sub get_statements {
	my ($self) = @_;
	return @{$self->{statements}};
}

=head3 $mt940->get_transactions()

Returns an array of transactions in the data given to parse(). This is simply
implemented as:

  return (map { @{$_->{transactions}} } $self->get_statements());

=cut

sub get_transactions {
	my ($self) = @_;
	return (map { @{$_->{transactions}} } $self->get_statements());
}
